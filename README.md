Documentation for my 10" (half-width) server rack build (no affiliate links)
### Rack Frame/Rails
(2x) Gator Rackworks 8U Rail Set (WARNING multiple screwholes are threaded entirely too tight to use, as well as other QC concerns. I'd shop around for another seller if I were to do this again. I went with the 8U option because they were the cheapest and a good balance of size)
- https://a.co/d/hG8DRCE
- $25.06 = 2 x $12.53
### Front/Back Screws
(2x) 25pk Gator Screws (buy the 25 packs, for some reason it's the cheapest per-screw, but you will likely end up wanting to buy a second pack)
- https://a.co/d/8askkZl
- $15.98 = 2 x 7.99
### Side Fasteners
- 12-24 x 1" Round-Head Screws
- 12-24 flat washers
- 12-24 hex nuts
### UPS (not decided/purchased yet, just notes for now)
- PDU might be unnecessary if network switch has POE and devices are compatible. If all devices are compatible but don't have a POE switch, consider injector(s)
- UPS options are still being discussed online, not many (if at all) 10" rackmount options besides DIY
